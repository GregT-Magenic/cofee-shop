# Coffee Shop
A complex Coffee Shop system intended as an exploration of domain-driven design

This is a project proposal for the 2021 Domain Driven Design class taught by Stuart Williams (@stuart-williams-magenic), Larry Smithmier (@lsmithmier), Jason Weber (@jasonw-magenic), and Rocky Lhotka (@rockfordlhotka). It is inspired by the examples described in REST in Practice by Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis, and Ian Robinson, but is intended to add complexity for a full exploration of DDD. The subject is a state-of-the-art IT system for managing a coffee shop business. This system will address complex and interrelated business concerns, including:

### Point-of-Sale / Ordering

Customers can order food, beverages, and merchandise. Some of these items may be immediately available, but others may require kitchen preparation from ingredients following a recipe and special requests for alteration.

### Payment Processing

Customers may pay for their orders using cash, credit cards, or other payment systems.

### Inventory Management

The coffee shop maintains an inventory of ingredients and supplies. These may be perishable, and may have special requirements for storage such as refrigeration. They might be purchased directly, used as an ingredient, or consumed without purchase (e. g. napkins). They are sourced from multiple suppliers.

### Workforce Management

The coffee shop manages different types of employees, such as baristas, managers, and maintenance. These employees have schedules with different requirements, like having at least one manager at all times or a preference for maintenance workers outside of business hours. Employees collect paychecks and receive performance reviews.

### Accounting

The coffee shop handles accounting functions in the course of doing business. These include expenses (e. g. related to inventory, employee payroll, utilities, or services), assets (e. g. kitchen appliances), and store owner equity.

### Marketing

Customers may participate in a loyalty program, in which they may receive email promotions and earn discounts.

## Unstructured brainstorming (feel free to ignore)

Equipment / Inventory: menu (specialty items, storage), process, warantees / service plans?

Physical Location: interior design / art, furniture, lighting, water, electricity, wifi, music

Workflow: standards, quality control, sales tracking, ordering supplies, inventory control, cash control

Key suppliers and backup suppliers: coffee, food, equipment, services

Ownership and legal structure: percentage ownership, responsibilities, compensation

Management, hr, payroll, maintenance, barista, customer

customers gather in groups vs personal space

crowding, line vs sit down

order and pickup counter

can get product from barista, fridge, food stand, merchandise stand

self-service coffee additives (e.g. milk/sugar)

POS system, loyalty program, email alerts

hr workforce management, schedule, performance review

kitchen equipment, storage, refrigeration, POS system (IT!)

Laws and regulations (maintaining license / permits)

rental agreement (physical space)
